For first time based on the guideline we had a dictionary of varibales and their categories.
but after each manual annotations by annotators, our dictionary has been updated with one bunch delay.

For example for bunch 1 and 2 we used the original dictionary
for bunch 3 (see the next paragraph for more details), we updated dictionary by the new accepted variables from manual annotation of bunch 2.
For bunch 4, we used the same list, IctusnetDict_28.11.2019_bunch_4.bsv.
For Bunch 5, we are going to update the dictionary by the new accepted variables form manual annotation of bunch 3.

But for bunch three, there was a mistake and the bunch 3 has been annotated based on a short list (wrong file). That is IctusnetDict_14.11.2019_bunch_3.bsv. 
But pre-annotated bunch 3 has been replaced with the correct one (IctusnetDict_28.11.2019_bunch_3.bsv) in CompareAnnotatons and EHR_HeaderDetector Projects.
