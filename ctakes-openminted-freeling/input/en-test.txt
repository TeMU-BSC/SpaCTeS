This is a test file to check how FreeLing is able to process it. The file contains several lines to be analyzed. I hope that the 
language selected will be English.
The lines can be long and the text could also be as long as desired. The then we are going to check the results.
So, the user is waiting for the results to check them.
The same user that now is writing this text and who is also programming the component. 
He hopes that Freeling Parser Package will do a good job, 
not only in the preliminary results but in the demo that we have to do in the Bank of America.
